SoulMem is a memory system specifically designed for role-playing tasks. It **aims to** enable more anthropomorphic outputs from LLMs, allowing simulated characters to remember important, emotionally relevant, and behavior-driving events like humans, and to establish connections between them. **It does not aim to** remember event details or factual knowledge with precise accuracy.

**Please Note!**: SoulMem is a memory system intended for **individual users** running on **personal computers**, and is not an enterprise-level solution.

## ✨ Core Features

-   ***Memory Consolidation & Evolution***: Memories are consolidated and generalized over time, forming higher-level cognitions.
-   ***Active Forgetting Mechanism***: Simulates the human forgetting curve, retaining important memories while fading trivial details.
-   ***Graph-based Association***: Achieves active memory association through a working memory subgraph.
-   ***Dynamic Memory Updates***: Supports real-time addition and updating of memories during interaction.
-   ***Short-term Memory Abstraction***: Processes short-term context through summarization mechanisms to prevent information overload.

## 🏗️ Design Philosophy

The core design philosophy of SoulMem is: ***"All characteristics and events belong to memory."***

Unlike traditional role-playing systems that rely on static "character cards," SoulMem posits that a character's personality, speech habits, behavioral patterns, etc., are all results of the interactive evolution of long-term memories. This design aims to better support the dynamic evolution of character personality and maintain high character consistency.

## 📁 Project Status & Architecture

***Current Status: Active Development***

*> 🚧 SoulMem is under active development and a stable version has not yet been released. We welcome interested developers to follow, discuss, and even contribute! Please refer to the* *`docs`* *directory for the latest architectural designs and development progress.*

- ***Important Notice***: The project has undergone architectural refactoring. The `main` branch contains the latest version. The old alpha version code can be found on the [`alpha_deprecated`](https://github.com/dynamder/SoulMem/tree/alpha_deprecated) branch.

- ***Detailed Architecture***: Please refer to [`docs/architecture/beta_ver.md`](docs/architecture/beta_ver.md) for the latest technical architecture documentation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The project is currently in its early development stages. Installation and basic usage tutorials will be provided here when an applicable version is available.

## 🔧 Development & CI

- Build: `cargo build --workspace --all-targets`
- Test: `cargo test --workspace`
- Format & lint: `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Mutation testing: `cargo mutants --workspace` (kill rate ≥90%, gated by `scripts/mutants_gate.py`)
- Pushes and PRs trigger build + tests on Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS; PRs also run diff-scoped mutants; a full mutants run happens every other week.
