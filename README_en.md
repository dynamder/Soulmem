SoulMem is a memory system specifically designed for role-playing tasks. It **aims to** enable more anthropomorphic outputs from LLMs, allowing simulated characters to remember important, emotionally relevant, and behavior-driving events like humans, and to establish connections between them. **It does not aim to** remember event details or factual knowledge with precise accuracy.

**Please Note!**: SoulMem is a memory system intended for **individual users** running on **personal computers**, and is not an enterprise-level solution.

## ✨ Core Features

-   ***Memory Consolidation & Evolution***: Memories are consolidated and generalized over time, forming higher-level cognitions.
-   ***Active Forgetting Mechanism***: Simulates the human forgetting curve, retaining important memories while fading trivial details.
-   ***Graph-based Association***: Achieves active memory association through a working memory subgraph.
-   ***Dynamic Memory Updates***: Supports real-time addition and updating of memories during interaction.
-   ***Short-term Memory Abstraction***: Processes short-term context through summarization mechanisms to prevent information overload.

## 🏗️ Design Philosophy

The core design philosophy of SoulMem is: ***"All characteristics and events belong to memory."***

Unlike traditional role-playing systems that rely on static "character cards," SoulMem posits that a character's personality, speech habits, behavioral patterns, etc., are all results of the interactive evolution of long-term memories. This design aims to better support the dynamic evolution of character personality and maintain high character consistency.

## 📁 Project Status & Architecture

***Current Status: Active Development***

*> 🚧 SoulMem is under active development and a stable version has not yet been released. We welcome interested developers to follow, discuss, and even contribute! Please refer to the* *`docs`* *directory for the latest architectural designs and development progress.*
